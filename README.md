Minesweeper is a puzzle game which the player will select a cell in a square grid continuously. Each cell hides a bomb or a value which displays the number of bombs in it's neighboring cells. Just to make it clear, neighboring cells is defined as adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally.The aim of MineSweeper is to determine the locations of 10 bombs, randomly placed in a 9x9 grid.
On each go, you type in the coordinates of a square, e.g. E4.
If there is a bomb in that square, you lose. Otherwise, the number of bombs directly surrounding that square, including diagonally, will appear in that square.
If that number is a 0, the squares around it will be 'opened' automatically, as there cannot be any bombs there, to save you time.
If you think you know the position of a bomb, type 'M' followed by the coordinates of that square, e.g. ME4.
You win by 'opening' all of the squares except those with bombs in.
NB: It is luck on the first move, and you may get to a stage where it is luck later in the game too.
Good luck!
